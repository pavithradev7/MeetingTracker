## Background
In our daily life, it is highly difficult to take attendance especially for the faculty and student assistants. 
It is difficult because students might leave the class just after the attendance has been registered or, the students might enter other student’s credentials in the attendance paper which would indicate the presence of that student in that class. Our attendance app will help the faculty to eliminate the above possibilities. The app would also eliminate the tiring process of calling out student’s names while taking the attendance. The app would basically generate a unique QR code for every student and the professor’s phone should just scan the QR code. After the QR code is scanned, the attendance would be marked present for that student. The app also allows to send, for every 2 minutes, the location coordinates of the student to the professor’s phone indicating that the student is in the class in that class duration.

## Credentials
You can register to the app by signing up and then you can login with those ID and password. For example, if you want to login as a test user, then your credentials will be 
      ID: test 
      Password: test
